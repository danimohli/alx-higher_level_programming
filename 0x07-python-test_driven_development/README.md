Testing is a critical software development process since it ensures the code is clean and works as expected. Choosing the right way to test your code before executing tests is crucial. 

Performing tests using the unittest framework allows us to test our code in an object-oriented approach. It supports many features such as test automation, setup, and code test teardown. Doctest, in contrast, is more suitable for documentation since we can insert it in the codeâ€™s docstrings.
